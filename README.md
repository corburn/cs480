## CS480 Assignment1 ##

Write a command line utility that takes any number of words on the command line and prints the words out, sorted according to the character at a certain specified position, which should also be specified via the command line. If two strings have the same character at the position of interest, their order does not matter.

To solve the problem, you are ONLY allowed to use pointers throughout the program. You are NOT allowed to use any arrays. In other words, you will not have a single bracket in your program.
